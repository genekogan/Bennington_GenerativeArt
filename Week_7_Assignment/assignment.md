### Assignment week 7

This week we worked with images and pixels.  Please do the following two assignments.

1) Find an image that you like. Draw multiple instances of it in a grid pattern and experiment with different strategies for tinting them different colors.

2) Experiment with generative pixel patterns, starting with the sketch p10_createImage. Inside the loop you have access to the x and y point. Make the colors a function of x and y. Try using any combination of noise, sine, random, mod (%), or anything else you can think of to create interesting color patterns.
