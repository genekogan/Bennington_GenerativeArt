 Using### Assignment week 3


There are two simple assignments this week.

1) Look at the final example, p19_perlin_noisyBeziers. Instead of controlling the coordinates using perlin noise, try to switch some or all of the coordinates to be controlled with sine curves instead. Try making bezier curves whose coordinates oscillate along the screen using sine curves, or perhaps a combination where some coordinates are fixed, some are moving with perlin noise, and some are moving with sine curves.

2) Look at the example, p18_perlin_noisyTriangles_2.  Add color variation to it according to some strategy. If you wish, you can also try to do the suggested improvements from assignment #1 but for the triangles as well.
